# Test driven development

- TDD <> Unit tests
- Driving design from tests
  - more about design than testing
- start by a test
  - use the test to design the external view of our code
- Red: write a test, run it and see it fail
  - put ourselves in the skin of somebody using the code
  - we have to be idiots
- Green: write the **simplest** to make the test pass
- Refactor: make the code & tests cleaner, more expressive
- mindset:
  - think about the system without thinking about the solution itself
  - work incrementally in very **small steps**
  - you're writing the test first, this makes your design the code to be testable
